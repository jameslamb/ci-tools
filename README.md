# ci_tools

Collection of miscellaneous scripts I like to use for CI in software projects. Developed in collaboration with [@austin3dickey](https://github.com/austin3dickey).

Any others borrowed from other projects have attribution in comments.

## Example

For an example project using many of these, see [doppel-cli](https://github.com/jameslamb/doppel-cli).
